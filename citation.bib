abstract="This paper explores the foundational insights and evolving perspectives within Design Science Research (DSR) by analyzing the reflections of authors who contributed some of the most pivotal and cited works in the field. Through in-depth interviews with 14 DSR experts, each representing a seminal and impactful publication, we investigate the motivations, challenges, and retrospective viewpoints that shaped their research contributions. Key themes include the authors' reflections on the original aims and main contributions of their work, considerations on what they might alter if revisiting their studies today, and advice for aspiring DSR researchers. These perspectives provide a unique lens into the evolution of DSR, highlighting both enduring principles and areas ripe for innovation. This study chronicles significant milestones in DSR as well as offers guidance for future research and practice, charting a path forward for scholars navigating this dynamic and impactful paradigm.",
